          <h1>The Fundamentals of Climate Change</h1><br>
          <p>Climate comprises of multiple aspects of our environment including humidity, atmospheric pressure, and temperature. Over the last century, humans have most definitely made their mark on planet Earth by, what seems like, doing everything they can to destroy it.<br><br>
            Because of this change in the climate, scientists around the world were in a frenzy, and as a result, terms like “Global Warming” and “The Greenhouse Effect” were born and garnered immense traction, rightfully so.<br><br>Today, a large proportion of people across the globe are aware of the Climate Crisis going on, but seem to rely mostly on organizations like the United Nations and NASA to be the ones dealing with this threat.
            
          </p><br>
  
          <h1>Some Important Facts:</h1><br>
          <p>Climatist creates a community to battle against Climate Change by bringing together people who care. Although humans have been reckless about their home, we have also worked hard to fight for it, and should continue doing so. <br><br>
            If we can be Climatists, we will be one step further in the battle as we would have adopted a mindset with the intent to make a change. This is not the solution to Climate Change, but it is a great way for people who feel like helping Climate Change is beyond their reach to start out in their journey and make a positive impact.
