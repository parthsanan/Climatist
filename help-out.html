        <h1 id="head">How to Act on Climate Change? </h1>
        <p>
          There exists ambiguity related to how the climate crisis can be tackled. People have every right to be <a href="https://www.iberdrola.com/social-commitment/what-is-ecoanxiety">eco-anxious</a>, but we need to overcome our fears in order to help our environment. Some of the ways we can help battle Climate Change are listed below. <br><br>

        <h2>Additional Ways to Help Out:</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to inculcating these practices in our daily lives, another way to help is by making a small contribution to organizations working to battle Climate Change. Because all of us cannot be on the frontline of battling climate change, contributing provides us a chance to indirectly provide necessary resources to these organizations.
        </p>

        <p>We can also help out by making changes in our lifestyle. The global average for carbon footprint of just one person is approximately <a href="https://www.pawprint.eco/eco-blog/average-carbon-footprint-globally">7 tonnes CO2e per year</a>. Reduction in our carbon footprints is essential because it enables a higher standard of living by ensuring cleaner air, water, and food for future generations. Some of the changes that can be made are mentioned below.
        </p>
        
        <ol id="list">
          <li>Reducing consumption of meats or experimenting with different types of vegetarian diets can be one step. Globally, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-59232599">livestock contributes to 14% of all man made greenhouse-gases</a>. According to a study published in 2017 in the journal Environmental Research Letters, red meat can have up to 100 times the environmental impact of plant based food. </li>
          <li>Discarding clothes from time to time is not recommended as they can fill up landfills. In addition, purchasing recycled clothing is also beneficial to the environment.</li>
          <li>Prioritizing walking, cycling, public transport over individual vehicles is also very important because a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle">typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year</a>.</li>
          <li>Sigle use plastics are extremely damaging for the environment as they become a part of marine litter, further polluting water bodies like oceans and seas.</li>
          <li>Basic steps like switching off electrical appliances when not in use, reducing the usage of air-conditioners, and using products that are renewable can do much good for the planet.</li>
