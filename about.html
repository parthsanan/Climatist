          <h1>The Story of Climatist</h1><br>
          <p>
            Climatist was born when I decided I wanted to do what I could to help my home. It was formed with the aim to view the impending Climate crisis with a perspective of optimism as well as realism. Climatist is a medium for people to realize that there is a dire need for action and that this realization shall be achieved by the act of spreading awareness.

            <h1>About Me</h1><br>
            <text>Hi! I am a 17-year-old called Parth Sanan. I like playing football and being digitally creative while sitting behind my laptop display. I am happy that Climatist no longer remains a figment of my imagination and that I was able to build Climatist because of my passion towards doing whatever I could do to help combat climate change and towards computer science. I hope that Climatist can become a medium for information about Climate Change and inspire others to help save our Earth.</text><br>
